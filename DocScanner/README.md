This is a PyTorch/GPU re-implementation of the paper [DocScanner: Robust Document Image Rectification with Progressive Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mmCUj90rHyuO1SmpLt361youh-07Y0sD/view?usp=share_link).

## ðŸš€ Demo [(Link)](https://docai.doctrp.top:20443/)
***Note***ï¼šThe model version used in the demo corresponds to ***"DocScanner-L"*** as described in the paper.
1. Upload the distorted document image to be rectified in the left box.
2. Click the "Submit" button.
3. The rectified image will be displayed in the right box.

### Examples

## Training
- We train the **Document Localization Module** using the [Doc3D](https://github.com/fh2019ustc/doc3D-dataset) dataset. Besides, [DTD](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/) dataset is exploited for background data enhancement.
- We train the **Progressive Rectification Module** using the [Doc3D](https://github.com/fh2019ustc/doc3D-dataset) dataset. Here we use the background-excluded document images for training.

## Inference 
1. Put the [pre-trained DocScanner-L](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W1_DJU8dfEh6FqDYqFQ7ypR38Z8c5r4D?usp=sharing) to `$ROOT/model_pretrained/`.
2. Put the distorted images in `$ROOT/distorted/`.
3. Run the script and the rectified images are saved in `$ROOT/rectified/` by default.
    ```
    python inference.py
    ```

## Evaluation
- ***Important.*** In the [DocUNet Benchmark](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/docunet.html), the '64_1.png' and '64_2.png' distorted images are rotated by 180 degrees, which do not match the GT documents. It is ignored by most of the existing works. Before the evaluation, please make a check. Note that the performances in most of the existing work are computed with these two ***mistaken*** samples.
- For reproducing the following quantitative performance on the ***corrected*** [DocUNet Benchmark](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/docunet.html), please use the geometric rectified images available from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QBe26xJwIl38sWqK2ZE9ke5nu0Mpr4dW?usp=sharing). For the ***corrected*** performance of [other methods](https://github.com/fh2019ustc/Awesome-Document-Image-Rectification), please refer to the paper [DocScanner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14968v2.pdf).
- ***Image Metrics:***  We use the same evaluation code for MS-SSIM and LD as [DocUNet Benchmark](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/docunet.html) dataset based on Matlab 2019a. Please compare the scores according to your Matlab version. We provide our Matlab interface file at ```$ROOT/ssim_ld_eval.m```.
- ***OCR Metrics:*** The index of 30 documents (60 images) of [DocUNet Benchmark](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/docunet.html) used for our OCR evaluation is ```$ROOT/ocr_img.txt``` (*Setting 1*). Please refer to [DewarpNet](https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/DewarpNet) for the index of 25 documents (50 images) of [DocUNet Benchmark](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/docunet.html) used for their OCR evaluation (*Setting 2*). We provide the OCR evaluation code at ```$ROOT/OCR_eval.py```. The version of pytesseract is 0.3.8, and the version of [Tesseract](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/) in Windows is recent 5.0.1.20220118. Note that in different operating systems, the calculated performance has slight differences.
- ***W_v and W_h Index:*** The layout results of [DocUNet Benchmark](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/docunet.html) is available at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PcfWIowjM0AVKhZrRwGChM-2VAcUwWrF?usp=sharing).
